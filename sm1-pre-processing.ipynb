    "# Pre-processing:\n",
    "This is the first sub-module of the `activities_recommendation` module. Firstly we define the purpose of the module and the challenges, then we will dive into the features of the sub-module and then will walkthrough the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activities Recommendation\n",
    "Each trip consists of a certain number of days. In addition to travel and hotel-stay, the travellers can engage in different activities during their trip. The Activity Recommendation Logic aims to analyze Viator / TripAdvisor activities/attraction data and generate day-wise activity recommendations keeping their schedule, budget and interests in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges? \n",
    "Even before going into the recommendation channel, there are various challenges we encouter with the initial data we are getting:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The expected data for each activity\n",
    "- For each activity we need the following data: `num_reviews`, `star_rating`, `prices`, `duration`, `age-group allowed`, `location`, `timings`\n",
    "- And, we also need the attraction data to which an activity is mapped to: `attraction_name`, `star_rating`, `num_reviews`, `hours` (availability times), `location`\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the default data we have activity data without any association with the attraction data -- inshort, we need to map the activities to the attraction data. Moreover, even the viator data alone doesn't suffice all the attributes we need for the activity data -- some of them are present in our 3rd dataset, which is `ta_activity` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The mapping\n",
    "Even if we can figure out this much, mapping the activity data to the attraction data is not that straightforward since there is no common column in these two data on which we can do an inner join. Thus, we need to firstly **extract** the names out of the activity data, and then map it to the attraction data. We will see how is that done with the use of `Standford NER Tagger`, and `fuzzy matching`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The optimization\n",
    "Even if we can do the mapping properly with matching attributes, there is a lot of data to be mapped, indeed we have about **240 billion** comparisions to do! So we need to optimize the code correctly. Moreover, this adds up one more reason for us to preprocess the data properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## In this sub-module\n",
    "In this sub-module we have these two input data sources\n",
    "- Trip advisor activities data: From an `os.walk` through the server recursively (around 73,000 entries)\n",
    "- Viator activity dataset: Available as a `.csv` file format (around 390,000 entries)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sub-module, our aim would be to sanitize the **Viator activity dataset** by removing the null rows. And then map it to the **Trip advisor activities**. This way we would have all the attributes for the activities we need (except `age-groups allowed`, by manual picking and checking of the data, I didn't find this key to be present there). We export the data at each step to `.csv` files for later use. These are the outputs we will have by the end of this sub-module.\n",
    "- `TA_ACTS_OS_WALK` (approx. 73,000 entries): Will have the trip advisor activity data from the `os.walk`.\n",
    "- `VIATOR_ACTS_CLEANED` (approx. 268,000): Will have the Viator activities after the null rows are removed.\n",
    "- `MAPPED_ACT_VIA_TO_TA` (approx. 32,000 entries): Will have the mapped activities from Viator to Trip advisor, will have columns of both of these datasets.\n",
    "- `VIATOR_MAPPED_ACTS` (approx. 32,000 entries): Will have the mapped Viator activities -- this will have the columns from the viator dataset alone.\n",
    "- `VIATOR_UNMAPPED_ACTS` (approx. 236,000): Will have the unmapped Viator activities."
