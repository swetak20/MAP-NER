    "# Fuzzy matching Attractions:\n",
    "This is the third sub-module of the `activities_recommendation` module. Firstly we define the purpose of the module and the challenges, then we will dive into the features of the sub-module and then will walkthrough the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context:\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the aim for the 4-level sub-module is to map Viator activities to the TripAdvisor attraction data. In the `pre-processing` sub-module, we splitted the Viator activities in mapped and unmapped activities (ref. TripAdvisor activities). In the `NER_Extraction` module, we extracted the potential attraction names out of the activity description. Now we will do a fuzzy matching with the TripAdvisor attraction data, finally mapping the activities with the attraction. There is a later stage also, where we do an inner join on this data to finally get the desired `.csv` output\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialization:\n",
    "We import the required packages and convert the string based lists (due to reading from `.csv`) to python lists, we also add a new column called `possible_attractions`, which for now has an empty list, but in the end will have the desired mappings."

    "## The Fuzzy Matching Algorithm\n",
    "***Input***: An array of `locations` or `organizations` (extracted via `NER_Extraction` module) and an `attraction_name` (actually a complete record for `attraction-data`)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Output***: An array of tuples. (`ner_name`, `matched_attraction_name`, `percentage_of_match`)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Algorithm:***\n",
    "For every `ner_name` and `att_name` we check the number of words in both of them and then generate the `n_grams` for the one which has greater number of words, `n` (`n` value in `n_grams`) being the no. of words of the other variable. Then for each `n_gram` we check the `fuzz.ratio` (which is simply the edit distance) of it with the other variable (both have the same no. of words), and finally check the `max_fuzz_ratio`. This would be more clear with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "***Input***: `['grand canyon']` (location) and `\"Grand Canyon National Park\"`\n",
    "- since number of words in `'grand canyon' < \"Grand Canyon Tour by EX Travels!\"`, so `n = 2` and `n_grams` for `att_name` would be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_grams = [('Grand', 'Canyon'), ('Canyon', 'National'), ('National', 'Park')]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now we join words for each tuple and do a `fuzz.match`. In this case, it would be `> 95%` match and thus, this is a possible attraction for the activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "**What about something like `Gambhir River` and `Ganga River at Varanasi`?**\n",
    "- If we hadn't generated the `n_grams`, doing a `fuzz.partial_ratio` would give almost `100%` match. Thus, producing a false positive. \n",
